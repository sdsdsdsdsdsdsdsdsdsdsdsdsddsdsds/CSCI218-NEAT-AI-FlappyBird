![Flappy Bird AI](https://example.com/flappy-bird-ai-image.png)

Welcome to the **CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird** repository! This project features a Python-based AI agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Developed as part of a CSCI218 course project, this repository utilizes Pygame and NEAT-Python to create a fun and engaging learning experience.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop an AI agent that can effectively play Flappy Bird. The agent uses the NEAT algorithm, which evolves neural networks over generations. Each generation attempts to improve the agent's performance in the game. 

### Why NEAT?

NEAT is a powerful evolutionary algorithm that allows for complex behavior to emerge from simple rules. It is well-suited for tasks like game playing, where the environment is dynamic and requires adaptability. 

### Key Features

- **AI Agent**: An agent that learns to navigate through obstacles.
- **Pygame Integration**: A user-friendly interface to visualize the game.
- **NEAT-Python**: Utilizes the NEAT algorithm for neural network evolution.
- **Real-Time Learning**: The agent improves as it plays more games.

## Installation

To get started, you need to set up your environment. Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsddsdsds/CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird.git
   cd CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird
   ```

2. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame neat-python
   ```

4. **Download and Execute the Game**:
   You can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/sdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsddsdsds/CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird/releases). Follow the instructions provided there to execute the game.

## Usage

Once you have installed everything, you can start the game. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the Flappy Bird game with the AI agent. You can observe how the agent learns to navigate through the pipes.

### Game Controls

- **Spacebar**: Flap the bird.
- **Quit**: Close the game window.

## How It Works

### NEAT Algorithm

NEAT evolves neural networks through a process of mutation and selection. The key components include:

- **Population**: A group of neural networks that compete against each other.
- **Fitness Function**: Measures how well each network performs in the game.
- **Mutation**: Introduces random changes to networks to explore new strategies.
- **Crossover**: Combines successful networks to create offspring.

### Training Process

1. **Initialization**: Start with a population of simple networks.
2. **Evaluation**: Each network plays the game, and its score is recorded.
3. **Selection**: The best-performing networks are selected for reproduction.
4. **Reproduction**: Selected networks undergo mutation and crossover to create the next generation.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the evaluation and selection process until the agent reaches a satisfactory performance level.

### Visualizing the Learning Process

The game provides real-time feedback on the agent's performance. You can see how it adapts and improves over time. This visual representation helps in understanding the learning dynamics.
